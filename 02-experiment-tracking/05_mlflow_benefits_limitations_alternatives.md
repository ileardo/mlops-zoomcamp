## Remote tracking server

### Benefits
* Share experiments with other data scientists
* Collaborate with others to build and deploy models
* Give more visibility of the data science efforts

### Issues
* Security  
* Scalability
* Isolation 

### Limitations
* Autentication & users: open source version of MLflow doesn't provide any sort of authentication
* Data versioning: to ensure full reproducibility we need to version the data used to train the model. MLflow doen't provide a built-in solution
* Model/Data monitoring & alerting: this is outside of the scope of MLflow
